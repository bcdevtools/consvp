# ConsVP
A simple utility for watching pre-vote status on Tendermint/CometBFT chains. It will print out the current pre-vote status for each validator in the validator set. Useful for watching pre-votes during an upgrade or other network event causing a slowdown.

A full rework of [pvtop](https://github.com/blockpane/pvtop) by [@blockpane](https://github.com/blockpane) and plus some miracles
- [ ] Live streaming mode, sharing voting information to everyone
- [x] Display Block Hash fingerprint which the validator voted on
- [x] Allow scrolling (thanks to [@freak12techno](https://github.com/freak12techno))
- [x] Update binary to the latest version: `cvp --update`

## Installation
```bash
go install -v github.com/bcdevtools/consvp/cmd/cvp@latest
# Require go 1.19+
```

## Basic usage
### PVTop-like command
```bash
cvp
# => use http://localhost:26657
```

```bash
cvp 19000
# => use http://localhost:19000
```

```bash
cvp https://rpc.cosmos.network
# => use https://rpc.cosmos.network
```

```bash
cvp https://rpc.example-consumer.network https://rpc.cosmos.network
# => use https://rpc.example-consumer.network as consumer network RPC endpoint
# and use https://rpc.cosmos.network as producer network RPC endpoint (typically Cosmos Hub)
```
